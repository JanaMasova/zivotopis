            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>After almost four years of working as a proofreader, I have started to feel it is time for a change. It
                was my experience with Czechitas that sparked my enthusiasm in IT. Currently, I am working as a QA
                Engineer for Avast and I am trying to improve my skills in automation testing in my free time.</p>
